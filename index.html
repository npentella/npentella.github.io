	<p>This site is obviously pretty bare bones, but 	who am I to talk :).  It actually has a ton of 	great content, but looks very amateur (which it 	is) and is really hard to navigate.  Looking at 	the code, it seems to do its formatting and 	styling with HTML as opposed to CSS.  There's so 	much content on the home page alone and even more 	on other pages, so <code>nav</code> sections 	would be really helpful.</p>
	<p>The content on this site is what makes it 	great.  It's probably the most extensive resource 	on its subject and comes up high in relevant 	search results.  A little polish would go a long 	way, though.</p>
